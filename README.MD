# Virginia Hunting
The https://www.dgif.virginia.gov/hunting/regulations/ is confusing, so this project aims to create a user friendly web application that allows a user to see all the regulations at once for a specific place using a specific gun.

This project makes no claims as to the accuracy of the regulations, always check the DGIF website and offical regulations.
USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!
